============================= TODO ====================================

transpose matrix returned by path to solve conflicts between x and y [KO]

clone army needs to be reduced (10 is too big of a recursion) => 6 seems good

x values not always valid (error on some maps) => car cannot pas gaps of 2 or
less

need to add diagonal searching for next position [OK]

need to affine the car army to be able not to crash into walls when car is too
close to a wall

conflict between alignement function and clone army movements

the car has a tendency to crash if there is no grass tile arround blocks

cant resolve map that are too tricky
